## Xmen
[Xmen](https://robw4.github.io/xmen/) is a python api and command line tool I developed from the
 ground up for writing and running experiments. The user
  writes clean python code with minimal modifications and
 xmen takes care of the rest, including configuring, running and
  recording experiments, interfacing with the slurm job
   scheduler and visualising experiments from the command line.

A lot of work was put into developing xmen and a lot of fun had
 in the process. It is now a key component of my workflow which I
  depend upon every day in my research. Please do give it a go and
   let me know what you think! For more info please see the xmen
    project [website](https://robw4.github.io/xmen/)

## Website
This website was built using [jeckyll]() and in doing so I
 ended up developing my own Jeckyll theme. This was a complete first
  for me and I learnt a lot through the process. The aim of the
  theme was to be as research friendly as possible with built in
   math support, easy page navigation and support for project
    pages. Much of the appearance is
     inspired by latex. Some work still needs to
      be done to get the theme into a sharable state for an
       official release. In the meantime you can find the sourcecode for this site
    [here](https://github.com/robw4/robw4.github.io).

## Vim
Over the lockdown I got a little obsessed with vim and vim
 plugins which have since become a key part of my workflow over the
  last year as all work has gone remote. For anyone who is
   interested you can find my vim config
   [here](https://github.com/robw4/vim).
