I am a final year PhD student researching with the [Applied
 Artificial
 Intelligence Lab (A2I)](https://ori.ox.ac.uk/labs/a2i/) attached
  to the
  [Oxford Robotics Institute](https://ori.ox.ac.uk/), University of
   Oxford. Our research focuses on the application of AI and machine
    learning to better enable robots to robustly and effectively
     operate in complex real-world environments. 
   
   In my own research
      I am attempting to better harness the potential of radar for
       autonomous driving and robotic applications, through the
        application of state-of-the art machine learning approaches
        . For more information see my [research page](). More broadly
         I am
         interested in anything machine learning with a particular
          focus on generative modelling and Bayesian inference.

me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rob-weston-a1289a177/), or reach out via [email](mailto:robw
@robots.ox.ac.uk). I am
 currently looking for jobs at the intersection of robotics
  autonomous
  driving and machine learning.
