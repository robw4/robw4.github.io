I am a final year PhD student researching with the [_Applied
 Artificial
 Intelligence Lab (A2I)_](https://ori.ox.ac.uk/labs/a2i/) attached
  to the
  [_Oxford Robotics Institute_](https://ori.ox.ac.uk/), University of
   Oxford. Our research focuses on the application of AI and machine
    learning to better enable robots to robustly and effectively
     operate in complex real-world environments. 
   
   In my own research
      I am attempting to better harness the potential of radar for
       autonomous driving and robotic applications, through the
        application of state-of-the art machine learning approaches
        . For more information see my [_research page_]({% link
         publications.html %}). More broadly
         I am
         interested in anything machine learning with a particular
          focus on generative modelling and Bayesian inference.

  @robots.ox.ac.uk). I am
   currently looking for jobs at the intersection of robotics
    autonomous
    driving and machine learning with an option to publish.
