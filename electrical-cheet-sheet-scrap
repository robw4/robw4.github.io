## Maxwell's equations
We will begin our journey with Maxwell's equation which together with the Lorentz force equation constitute the foundation of classical electromagnetism: from these five equations it is possible to derive all results in classical electromagnetism and optics.
The chasm between learning what you need to to pass an exam, and learning so that you actually understand a topic is vast. There is lots I had forgotten, and much more still that, in hindsight, I don't think I really ever understood in the first place. Whilst everything is still fresh in my mind, this blog post aims to describe my understanding of the topic now, in the hope it might be a useful resource for my students or anyone else interested starting out in electrical engineering.

In order to express these equations we will need some mathematical machinery from multivariate calculus which I will now define. Let $\Omega$ be a fixed volume with a closed boundary survace $\partial \Omega$.




In order to exemplify the elegance of this system I am going to begin by simply stating the equations.



Whilst, elegant and concise, they require a foundation in vector calculus, and at times can seem more abstract than the ideas of current and voltage typically familiar to us. But, Maxwell's equations do not come from pure abstract reasoning, rather they aim to describe real world empirical observations. Through this lens the empirical is key rather than the abstract. Developing a model from real world observations we hope to answer the question "if this is true, then what else follows?". These new predictions can in turn be tested in the real world and our model refined. In some cases, this is a re-writing of the equations to account for new factors that were previously missed. In other cases this might rely on defining and deriving new mathematical machinery allowing relationships to be expressed that previously could not. The latter of these facts is something I personally haven't previously given enough weight to in the past. There is a temptation to see maths and science as separate entities, with maths providing the set of absolute rules, facilitating physical discovery. In reality this relationship is far more symbiotic. The discovery of calculus by Newton and Leibniz was born from there attempts to explain movement for example. Similarly, in unifying

 Instead, a typical course might start with a discussion of more elementary topics such as ohms law and krirchoff's current laws and by simply stating the mathematical properties of inductors and capcitors.

 Before doing so I want to give a brief discussion about why starting with Maxwell's equations, which rely on a slightly greater mathematical foundation, and at times can seem inherently abstract is a good idea rather?

I hope it will be a useful resource

It took me a long time to get to a point where I felt like

Over the last few years I have been teaching a first year undergraduate course on electrical engineering. And naturally, this has forced me to revisit and rethink much of what I thought I new about electrical circuit analysis. There is lots I have forgotten, and much more still that, in hindsight, I did not really understand in the first place.


Perhaps the thing I struggled with the most was trying to see the bigger picture, not only being able to recite results but explain fully, or as well as we possibly can

Whilst, by no means the full picture, I feel like over the last year things are becom

On reflection and part of this process

The field of electromagnetism -- much like the field of physics in general -- is tasked with trying to explain phenomena observed in the real world. In the beginning, its origin can be found in attempts to explain natural phenomena such as lightning and shadows. Over time, as theories are developed, tested and extrapolated, new phenomena are observed, which must be explained with new theories. And, this process repeats. Gradually, links between these often seemingly unrelated phenomena, are discovered and explained through physical models, until today the field of electromagnetism has grown to explain and define not only electricity and magnetism but also optics under one unified theory. This is expressed through maxwell's four equations -- relating charges and currents to electric and magnetic fields -- in combination with the lorentz force equation.


Today, typically anything that can be explained by this theory _is_ regarded as part of the field of electromagnetism.

Before teaching a topic in physics it is first worth briefly considering the question of where our understanding of physics comes from?

### Maxwell's equations



At the heart of electromagnetism lie Maxwell's equations. These four equations, alongside the Lorentz force equation provide a fully unified theorem of classical electromagnetism. And in beginning my journey of exploration of electrical engineering it would be remiss of me not to mention them.


For many there existence is remarkable, the fact that all electromagnetic effects can be reduced to four lines of equations,

Maxwell's equations unify our understanding of electricity and magnetism: through the application of these equations alongside the lorentz force equation it is possible to derive all of classical electromagnetism.





But through abstraction it becomes possible to link seemingly unrelated observations together in a complete and unifying framework, providing us with new insights, and enabling the next step of discovery (save in the knowledge that our foundations are solid).


 Assuming this foundation is true, we are able to derive results purely in the abstract which in turn must also be true. In this way Maxwell's equation provide a deep insight into the benefits and satisfaction attained through the scientific process.



 In itself this provides us with a mechanism through which it is possible to derive new results, whilst having the reassurance that the foundations are theory relies upon are grounded to real world observations.




Before stating Maxwell's equations it is worth first defining some notations and refreshing





## Active circuits
### Quantum Theory
Bound States and Discrete Energy Levels
: A particle subjected to a potential such that the particle has a tendency to remain localised in one or more regions of space is in a *bound state*. Particles in a bound state can only take on certain discrete values of energy.
> Eg. chemical bonds, protons and neutrons all correspond to bound states

Pauli Exclusion Principle
: Two or more identical fermions cannot occupy the same quantum state within a quantum system simultaneously.

## Semi Conductors
Conductance and ohms Law
: Under an applied electric field $\boldsymbol{E}$ charges will experience a force equal to $\boldsymbol{F} = q \boldsymbol{E}$ (lorentz) and if they are unconstrained accelerate. But t


Charge Carriers in semi-conductors
: Under an electric field $\epsilon$ free charges will experience a force $F = q \epsilon$ and will on average be accelerated to a drift velocity $v = \mu \epsilon$.

Semi-Conductors and the Bond Model
: In an electric field $\epsilon$ free charges will drift with velocity $v = \mu \epsilon$ where $\mu$ is a material property known as *mobility*. The total current is given as, $$J =J_n + J_p = (qn \mu_n + q p \mu_p) \epsilon \implies \sigma = q(n\mu_n + p \mu_p)$$ where $\sigma$ is the *conductivity*. *Intrinsic* semi-conductors have one hole per free electron such that $n_i = p_i$.

Band Theory
: As a result, the electron energy levels of a lattice of atoms will split and merge forming bands of allowed energy levels. At $T=0K$ every state within the *valence band* will be completely occupied by electrons and the next highest energy level the *conductance band* will be completely free of electrons.  The energy gap $\Delta E = E_c - E_v$ is the difference between the lowest energy state in the conductance band $E_c$ and the highest energy state in the valence band $E_v$.  At temperatures above absolute zero the probability that a particular energy level $E$ will be occupied by an electron in a system at thermal equilibrium is given by a Femi-Dirac distribution $$F(E) = \frac{1}{e^{(E - E_f)/k_BT} + 1}$$ where $E_f$ is the fermi-level corresponding to $F(E)=0.5$ for all temperatures.
