abstract: I am a final year PhD student researching with the <a href="https://ori.ox.ac.uk/labs/a2i/">Applied Artificial Intelligence Lab (A2I)</a> attached to the <a href="https://ori.ox.ac.uk/">Oxford Robotics Institute</a>, University of 
   Oxford.
   My research focuses on the application of AI and machine
   learning to better enable robots to robustly and effectively
   operate in complex real-world environments.
   In my PhD I am attempting to better harness the potential of radar for
   autonomous driving and robotic applications, through the
   application of state-of-the art machine learning approaches. 
   For more information see my publications below. More recently I have pivoted more
   towards machine vision - I have spent the last three months interning with Nvidia developing systems for 
   large scale semantic 3D mapping and scene understanding using Stereo cameras for AV applications.

### Xmen
[Xmen](https://robw4.github.io/xmen/) is a python api and command line tool I developed from the
 ground up for writing and running experiments. The user
  writes clean python code with minimal modifications and
 xmen takes care of the rest, including configuring, running and
  recording experiments, interfacing with the slurm job
   scheduler and visualising experiments from the command line.

A lot of work was put into developing xmen. It is now a key
 component of my workflow which I
  depend upon every day in my research. Please give it a go and
   let me know what you think! For more info please see the xmen
    project [website](https://robw4.github.io/xmen/)

### Website
In building this website I developed mu own [jeckyll]() theme. This
 was a complete first for me and I learnt a lot through the process
 . The aim was to develop a theme that is as research friendly as
  possible with built in math support, easy page navigation and
   support for project
    pages. Much of the appearance is
     inspired by latex. Some work still needs to
      be done to get the theme into a sharable state for an
       official release. In the meantime you can find the sourcecode for this site
    [here](https://github.com/robw4/robw4.github.io).

### Vim
Over the lockdown vim and vim
 plugins which have since become a key part of my workflow over the
  last year as all work has gone remote. For anyone who is
   interested you can find my vim config
   [here](https://github.com/robw4/vim).
