  <dt>Lorentz equation</dt>
  <dd>The total force experienced by a charge moving through an electric field of strength $\bm{E}$ (V / m = F / q) and magnetic field $\bm{B}$ is given as <script type="math/tex">\bm{F} = q \bm{E} + q \bm{v} \times \bm{B}</script>. From the lorentz equation a wire carrying current $i$ at an angle $\theta$ to a magnet field $B$ will experience a force equal to $F = Bil \sin \theta$.</dd>
  <dt>Gauss’s Law</dt>
  <dd>The total amount of electric flux $\Phi_{E}$ passing through the closed boundary $\partial \Omega$  of volume $\Omega$ is proportional to the total charge $Q$ contained within it, <script type="math/tex">\Phi_{E}= Q/ \epsilon</script> where $\Phi_{E} :=\oiint_{\partial \Omega} \mathbf{E} \cdot \mathrm{d} \mathbf{S}$ and $Q := \iiint_{\Omega} \rho \mathrm{d} V$. The constant $\epsilon$ is the <em>permittivity</em> of the medium and is often expressed as $\epsilon = \epsilon_0 \epsilon_r$ where $\epsilon_0$ is the <em>permittivity</em> of free space. This equation can alternatively be expressed in terms of the <em>electric displacement field</em> or <em>D-field</em> $\mathbf{D} := \epsilon \mathbf{E}$.  For a field of strength $E$ passing normally through an area $A$ the electric flux density is given by $\Phi_{E} = EA$.</dd>
  <dt>Ampere’s circuit Law</dt>
  <dd>The line magnetic field along a contour $\partial \Sigma$ enclosing area $\Sigma$ is proportional to the total current passing through it. <script type="math/tex">\oint_{\partial \Sigma} \mathbf{B} \cdot \mathrm{d} \boldsymbol{l} = \mu I</script>. The constant $\mu$ is the <em>permeability</em> of the medium often expressed as $\mu = \mu_0 \mu_r$. The current $I$ is composed of two parts $I = I_c + I_d$ with  conductive current $I_c :=\iint_{\Sigma} \mathbf{J} \cdot \mathrm{d} \mathbf{S}$ and <em>displacement</em> current $I_d := \epsilon \frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d} t} \iint_{\Sigma} \mathbf{E} \cdot \mathrm{d} \mathbf{S}$. Alternatively this can be written in terms of the <em>H-field</em> as $\mathbf{B} = \mu \bm{H}$. The conductive current corresponds to the actual movement of free charges whilst the displacement current results from changes in the magnetic field (for example the current flowing in a capacitor).
    <blockquote>
      <p>The displacement current is needed to satisfy continuity of current $\nabla \cdot \mathbf{J}=-\frac{\partial \rho}{\partial t}$ and to allow electromagnetic waves to propagate through free space when $\mathbf{J} = \mathbf{0}$</p>
    </blockquote>
  </dd>
  <dt>Maxwell-Faraday equation</dt>
  <dd>The electromotive force $\epsilon$ induced around a contour is proportional to the time rate of change of magnetic flux flowing through it, <script type="math/tex">\epsilon(t) = -\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{dt}} \Phi_{B}(dt)</script> with,$\Phi_{B} :=\iint_{\Sigma} \mathbf{B} \cdot \mathrm{d} \mathbf{S}$ and  $\epsilon := \oint_{\partial \Sigma} \mathbf{E} \cdot \mathrm{d} \boldsymbol{l}$. For a magnetic flux of strength $B$ passing normally to an area $A$ the magnetic flux reduces to $\Phi_{B} = B A$.</dd>
  <dt>Gauss’s Law for Magnetism</dt>
  <dd>The total magnetic field passing through a <em>closed surface</em>  $\partial \Omega$ is zero <script type="math/tex">\oiint_{\partial \Omega} \mathbf{B} \cdot \mathrm{d} \mathbf{S}=0</script>. As a result magnetic monopoles do not exist and magnetic field lines never begin or end but must form loops.</dd>

    <dd>The electrical potential is equal to the electrical potential energy $\Delta U$ per unit charge between two points. We consider the electric potential gained by unit charge as an electromotive force $\epsilon = \Delta U / q$ and the electric potential lost by each charge as a potential drop $v =  -\Delta  / q$. It is measured in $\text{V} = \text{JC}^{-1}$.</dd>

  <dt>Current</dt>
  <dd>Current is the rate of change of charge flowing through a circuit $i = dq / dt$. An electromotive force applies to a conductor will cause a current to flow.</dd>
  <dt>Power</dt>
  <dd>The power $p = v i$ dissipated by a circuit element is equal to the product of current flowing to it and potential difference across it</dd>

<h2 id="linear-circuits">Linear Circuits</h2>
<h3 id="linear-devices">Linear Devices</h3>
<p>The electrical properties of a linear device do not change with the voltage applied / current flowing to it. Resistors, inductors, capacitors and power sources are all linear devices.</p>

<dl>
  <dt>Resistors</dt>
  <dd>The current flowing through an ohmic resistor is proportional to the electromotive force applied to it <script type="math/tex">\epsilon = iR</script> (ohms law) where $R$ is the resistance of the component measured in ohms ($\Omega$). The resistance of a wire of length $l$, area $A$ and <em>resistivity</em> $\rho$ can be calculated as $R = \rho l / A$. Resistors in series can be combined as $R = \sum_k R_k$ and in parallel as $1/R = \sum_k 1/R_k$.</dd>
  <dt>Inductors</dt>
  <dd>A time-varying current $i(t)$ flowing through an inductor creates a time varying magnetic field and induces a back emf $\epsilon(t)$ opposing the flow of current <script type="math/tex">\epsilon(t) = - L \frac{d i}{ dt} \implies v(t) = L \frac{d i}{ dt}</script>. The constant $L$ is the inductance typically deduced from geometry of the inductor (using faradays law) and is given by $L = \Phi / i$ where $\Phi$ is the total amount of magnetic flux flowing through the inductor. The inductance of a solenoid of area $A$, length $l$ and turns $n$ is given by $L = \mu A N^2 / l$.</dd>
  <dt>Capacitors</dt>
  <dd>The amount of charge stored by a capacitor is proportional to the voltage applied across it $Q= CV$ where $C$ is <em>capacitance</em> measured in Farads typically calculated from the geometry of the capacitor (using gauss’s law). For a constant $C$ the current flowing through a capacitor is related to the potential difference across it as <script type="math/tex">i(t) = C \frac{dv}{dt}</script></dd>
  <dt>Power Sources</dt>
  <dd>An ideal voltage source is able to supply the same voltage to a circuit independent of the current drawn from it whilst an ideal current source is able to supply the same current to a a circuit independent of the potential difference across. Non-ideal voltage sources can be modelled as an ideal voltage source in series with a resistor and non-ideal current sources as an ideal current source in parallel with a resistor.</dd>
  <dt>Coupled Inductors</dt>
  <dd>A time-varying current $i_1(t)$ flowing through one inductor, induces a back emf in any inductor on the same magnetic circuit of magnitude equal to <script type="math/tex">\epsilon_2(t)= \pm M \frac{d i_1}{ dt}</script>. The constant $M$ is the mutual inductance $M=\Phi_{12} / i_1 = \Phi_{21} / i_2$ where $\Phi_{12}$ is the total amount of magnetic flux flowing through the 2nd inductor resulting from the first. The sign of this back emf is inferred from Amperes and Faradays law.</dd>

<h3 id="linear-circuits-1">Linear Circuits</h3>
<p>Any circuit which obeys the principle of superposition is linear. It is composed of only linear circuit components.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>This does not mean that the circuit is composed of only affine functions. Typically a circuit will be characterised by a set of ordinary differential equations.</p>
</blockquote>

<dl>
  <dt>Superposition</dt>
  <dd>The output of a circuit $f(x)$ for linear combination of signals $x =a x_{1} + b x_{2}$ is given by <script type="math/tex">F\left(a x_{1}+b x_{2}\right)=a F\left(x_{1}\right)+b F\left(x_{2}\right)</script> the weighted sum of its response to each signal.</dd>

<p>For any linear circuit kirchoff’s law’s hold:</p>

<dl>
  <dt>Kirchoff’s Law’s</dt>
  <dd>Kirchoff’s current law ($\sum_k i_k = 0$) states that the total current flowing into a node must sum to 0. Kirchoff’s voltage law ($\sum_k v_k = 0$) states that the summed potentials along any closed loop must sum to $0$.</dd>

  <dt>Norton / Thevenins Equivalence</dt>
  <dd>Any combination of resistors, voltage sources and current sources can be replaced with a single voltage source $V_{eq}$ in series with a resistor $R_{eq}$ (Thevenin’s theorem) or a current source $I_{eq}$ in parallel with $R_{eq}$ (Norton’s theorem). Defining the open circuit voltage $V_{oc}$ as the potential difference across the output terminals of a network (circuit) without any load applied and the short circuit current $I_{sc}$ as the current flowing between the output terminals when connected with an ideal wire $V_{eq}=V_{oc}$, $I_{eq}=I_{sc}$  and $R_{eq} = V_{oc} / I_{sc}$. Alternatively, if the current and voltage sources are not dependent on any other current or voltage in the circuit, $R_{eq}$ can be found by replacing all current sources with open circuits, short circuiting all voltage sources, and calculating</dd>
  <dt>Power Matching</dt>
  <dd>The maximum power is drawn from a power supply / network when the load resistance is matched to the internal resistance of the power supply / network corresponding to half the power being dissipated to the power supply, half to the load resistance and a resulting efficiency of $50\%$.</dd>
</dl>

<h3 id="ac-circuit-analysis">AC Circuit Analysis</h3>
<p>In AC circuit analysis we are interested in the response of a circuit to a steady-state signal of the form $x(t) = X_p \cos( \omega t + \alpha)$ where $\omega$ is the frequency measured in $\text{rad} \text{s}^{-1}$, $\alpha$ is the phase offset and and $X_p$ is the peak amplitude of the wave. The average root mean square of an AC signal $X_{rms} = 1 / T \int x(t) dt = X_p / \sqrt{2}$.</p>
